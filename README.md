The program uses JavaCV to receive the UDP stream and analyze the video for black screens and frozen frames.
The main purpose is to warn the user if the stream remains on a black screen for a certain period of time or if there is an error in the stream. This alert is currently sent via e-mail, but a phone call feature will be added soon.
